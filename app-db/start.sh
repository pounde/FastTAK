# On first boot: POSTGRES_DB creates the primary database (lldap).
# This script creates the nodered database if it doesn't exist yet.
#
# On subsequent boots: syncs the role password with POSTGRES_PASSWORD
# in case .env was regenerated while the data volume persisted.
# Works because pg_hba.conf trusts local (Unix socket) connections.
#
# PostGIS is not installed on app-db (DD-036 — official postgres image is
# multi-arch; postgis/postgis is amd64-only). Node-RED flows that need
# spatial queries should point at tak-database, which has PostGIS natively.

# Reap idle connections for good PostgreSQL hygiene.

# ── PGDATA persistence guard ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Catches the class of defect that reached review here: a postgres image
# moving PGDATA out from under docker-compose.yml's volume mount, silently.
# Reads the live setting from the running server rather than trusting the
# PGDATA env var, so a mismatch between what's configured and what the
# server actually opened is caught too. See tak-database/start.sh for the
# original pattern this mirrors; the guard script itself is not duplicated.

[app-db] ERROR: ${GUARD} is missing or not executable.

  The guard is bind-mounted from the host, so a mount that did not land or a
  stripped execute bit disables the one check that catches a PGDATA that has
  moved off the volume — while the container still reports a normal startup.
  Continuing would mean running unverified, so this is fatal.

  Confirm app-db's ./tak-database/check-pgdata-persistent.sh mount in
  docker-compose.yml (the guard script is shared, not duplicated), and that
  the file on the host is executable.
