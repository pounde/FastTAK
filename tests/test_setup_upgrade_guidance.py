"""setup.sh describes an upgrade honestly instead of prescribing a sequence.

FastTAK has no path that carries the databases across a TAK Server version
change. The 5.6 → 5.8 move was done by hand, once, as a fresh start; the
migration tooling built for it was deleted in 869093c. So the closing
instruction cannot be a procedure — it says what changed, tells the operator to
back up, and states that nothing carries the databases across. See #109.

Three things decide which closing instruction an operator gets: whether this is
an existing deployment (tak/ or .env was there), whether TAK_VERSION actually
changed, and whether the deployment is this checkout's own or one set up
elsewhere with -d. A re-run with the same bundle changes nothing and must not
imply otherwise; a -d deployment must not be told to run just recipes that act
on this checkout instead (#104).

These tests run setup.sh end to end with a stub `docker` on PATH — no daemon,
no images, no network.
