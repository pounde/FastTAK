# scripts/ensure-secrets.sh — provision required secrets in a .env file.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/ensure-secrets.sh <path-to-.env>
#
# Desired-state, not scenario-based: for every required key, if it is absent
# from the file it is appended; if it is present but empty it is filled;
# anything already set is left alone. Fresh installs and upgrades run the same
# code, so a secret introduced by a later release reaches deployments that
# already exist — a fresh-install-only branch cannot do that, which is how
# TOKENS_API_SECRET came to be missing from every upgraded .env.
#
# Prints the name of each key generated. Never prints a value.
#
# Note: the rewrite path replaces the file's inode. Containers that bind-mount
# .env directly (docker-compose.yml mounts ./.env into the monitor) keep the old
# inode until recreated, so provisioning is expected to run before the stack is
# brought up, which is where both callers invoke it.
