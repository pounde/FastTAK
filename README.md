# FastTAK

TAK ecosystem infrastructure — deployed with `docker compose up`.

## What Is This?

A Docker Compose stack for deploying and managing the TAK ecosystem:

- **TAK Server** — Official tak.gov Docker images (messaging, CA, web admin)
- **Caddy** — Automatic Let's Encrypt TLS and reverse proxy
- **MediaMTX** — RTSP/RTMP/HLS video streaming with optional recording ([guide](docs/video-recording.md))
- **LLDAP + ldap-proxy** — Lightweight LDAP authentication and user management
- **Node-RED** — Flow-based automation engine with pre-configured PostgreSQL and TAK Server connections
- **Monitor** — Management dashboard (user/group/certificate management and QR enrollment), health monitoring, and operations API

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker Engine** and **Docker Compose v2** (v2.20+) installed
2. **Official TAK Server release** ZIP from [tak.gov](https://tak.gov) — the **hardened** bundle, 5.8 or later (`takserver-docker-hardened-5.8-RELEASE-65.zip` or newer). See: [DD-051](docs/decisions.md#dd-051-tak-server-58-hardened-bundle-is-the-supported-floor).
3. **DNS** (subdomain mode only) — required for Let's Encrypt TLS and subdomain routing. Your FQDN and subdomains must resolve to the host's public IP. Not needed for direct mode.

## Deployment Modes

FastTAK supports two deployment modes, controlled by `DEPLOY_MODE` in `.env`:

**`direct`** — Port-based routing through Caddy with self-signed TLS. No DNS needed. Each service gets its own port (e.g., `https://192.168.1.50:8446`). Good for field deployments, air-gapped networks, and getting started quickly.

**`subdomain`** — Subdomain-based routing through Caddy with automatic Let's Encrypt TLS. Requires public DNS. Each service gets a subdomain (e.g., `https://monitor.tak.example.com`).

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pounde/FastTAK.git FastTAK && cd FastTAK

# One-time setup (builds images, extracts tak/, generates secrets)
./setup.sh takserver-docker-hardened-5.8-RELEASE-65.zip

# Set SERVER_ADDRESS to your IP or hostname, pick a DEPLOY_MODE
vim .env

# Start
./start.sh
```

`setup.sh` extracts the TAK Server release, builds Docker images, creates `.env` with generated secrets. You only run it once (or again to upgrade).

`start.sh` brings up the stack, waits for healthy, and shows connection info.

The fastest path to a working stack is `DEPLOY_MODE=direct` with `SERVER_ADDRESS` set to your machine's IP address — no DNS required.

For the full end-to-end walkthrough (user enrollment, video streaming), see [docs/quickstart-walkthrough.md](docs/quickstart-walkthrough.md).

### What `setup.sh` does

1. Verifies the bundle is the hardened one and at or above the 5.8 floor
2. Extracts `tak/`, strips the vendor's build-time certs, and fixes the file
   modes the release ZIP ships (nothing in it is executable)
3. Copies FastTAK's `healthcheck.sh` and `register-api-cert.sh` into `tak/`
4. Builds `takserver` and `takserver-database` from the bundle's **hardened**
   Dockerfiles
5. Creates `.env` from `.env.example` and generates every required secret

The README used to document these as manual `unzip` + `docker build` steps
against `Dockerfile.takserver-db`. That path bypassed the version floor and
reproduced the un-persisted-`PGDATA` defect DD-051 exists to prevent, and the
database entrypoint now refuses to start on a `PGDATA` that is not a mount
point — so it no longer works at all.

### Changing configuration

Edit `.env` and re-run the init containers to apply changes — no need to stop TAK Server:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate init-config init-identity
```

This re-runs the configuration and identity bootstrap containers, which read from `.env` and patch the running services. If you're running the monitor dashboard, it will detect `.env` changes and show the command to run.

For version changes or Dockerfile modifications, a full rebuild is needed:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

> [!CAUTION]
> `docker compose down -v` destroys all database data (PostgreSQL volumes). Use it only for a full reset. Certs and config in `./tak/` are always preserved.

## Services

All services start together — TAK Server, Caddy, MediaMTX, LLDAP (LDAP authentication), Node-RED, Monitor. Init containers handle configuration before TAK Server starts — no restart needed.

## Monitor

FastTAK includes a monitoring service with two components:

**API** (`/api/*`) — JSON endpoints for health checks, operations, and alerts. Use this to integrate with external tools, scripts, or your own dashboards. API documentation is available at `/api/docs` (Swagger UI).

- `GET /api/health/containers` — container health status for all services
- `GET /api/health/resources` — CPU/memory stats per container
- `GET /api/health/certs` — TAK certificate expiry
- `GET /api/health/tls` — TLS (Let's Encrypt) certificate expiry
- `GET /api/health/database` — CoT database size
- `GET /api/health/disk` — filesystem usage
- `GET /api/health/updates` — available version updates
- `GET /api/health/config` — configuration drift detection
- `GET /api/ops/certs/list` — list all certificates
- `POST /api/ops/certs/create-client/{name}` — create client certificate
- `POST /api/ops/certs/create-server/{name}` — create server certificate
- `POST /api/ops/certs/revoke/{name}` — revoke a certificate
- `GET /api/ops/service/{name}/logs` — view container logs
- `POST /api/ops/database/vacuum` — database maintenance
- `POST /api/ops/alerts/test-email` — test email alerting
- `POST /api/ops/alerts/test-sms` — test SMS alerting

**Dashboard** — A web UI built on top of the API. Auto-refreshing health grid, certificate status, update notifications, disk usage, activity log, and an operations page for cert management and database maintenance.

Access the dashboard at `https://<SERVER_ADDRESS>:8180` (direct mode) or `https://monitor.<SERVER_ADDRESS>` (subdomain mode). Both use LDAP authentication via Caddy.

## Configuration

All configuration lives in a single `.env` file. See `.env.example` for the full reference.

### Required variables

| Variable                | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SERVER_ADDRESS`        | IP, hostname, or FQDN that clients use to reach this server (e.g. `192.168.1.50`)                                                                                                        |
| `DEPLOY_MODE`           | `direct` (port-based, self-signed TLS) or `subdomain` (DNS-based, Let's Encrypt TLS)                                                                                                     |
| `TAK_WEBADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password for the `webadmin` account — auto-generated by `setup.sh`, stored in `.env` (run `grep TAK_WEBADMIN_PASSWORD .env` to retrieve it). Leave empty to skip webadmin user creation. |

Additional optional variables (SMTP relay, LDAP base DN, admin email) are documented in `.env.example`.

### Version pins

| Variable           | Default  | Description                   |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `TAK_VERSION`      | `5.8-RELEASE-65` | TAK Server Docker image tag, set by `setup.sh` |
| `LLDAP_VERSION`    | `v0.6.1` | LLDAP lightweight LDAP server |
| `MEDIAMTX_VERSION` | `1.15.5` | MediaMTX video streaming      |
| `NODERED_VERSION`  | `4.1`    | Node-RED                      |

### Port assignments (direct mode)

In direct mode, each service gets its own port on Caddy with self-signed TLS:

| Variable               | Default | Service              |
| ---------------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| `TAKSERVER_ADMIN_PORT` | `8446`  | TAK Server web admin |
| `MEDIAMTX_PORT`        | `8888`  | MediaMTX streaming   |
| `NODERED_PORT`         | `1880`  | Node-RED             |
| `MONITOR_PORT`         | `8180`  | Monitor dashboard    |

In direct mode, the bare `https://<SERVER_ADDRESS>` (port 443) redirects to the Monitor dashboard. Ignored in subdomain mode.

### Subdomains (subdomain mode)

In subdomain mode, each service gets a configurable subdomain:

| Variable              | Default     | Routes to            |
| --------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| `TAKSERVER_SUBDOMAIN` | `takserver` | TAK Server web admin |
| `MEDIAMTX_SUBDOMAIN`  | `stream`    | MediaMTX streaming   |
| `NODERED_SUBDOMAIN`   | `nodered`   | Node-RED             |
| `MONITOR_SUBDOMAIN`   | `monitor`   | Monitor dashboard    |

Ignored in direct mode. The Caddyfile is generated by `init-config` based on the deploy mode — changing variables requires re-running the init containers.

### Internal secrets

Generated by `setup.sh` — users don't interact with these directly. If not using `setup.sh`, generate with the noted commands.

| Variable             | Description                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TAK_DB_PASSWORD`    | TAK database password (`openssl rand -hex 16`)                                |
| `APP_DB_PASSWORD`    | App database password — shared by LLDAP and Node-RED (`openssl rand -hex 16`) |
| `LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD` | LDAP service account password (`openssl rand -hex 16`)                        |

## Ports

### Always exposed (both modes)

| Port | Service    | Protocol                                            | Auth        |
| ---- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 80   | Caddy      | HTTP (redirect to HTTPS)                            | —           |
| 443  | Caddy      | HTTPS — redirects to Monitor (direct) or subdomains | LDAP        |
| 8089 | TAK Server | CoT over TLS                                        | Client cert |
| 8443 | TAK Server | Client-cert HTTPS (mutual TLS)                      | Client cert |
| 8554 | MediaMTX   | RTSP — video ingress from cameras, drones           | None        |
| 1935 | MediaMTX   | RTMP — video ingress from OBS, encoders             | None        |

### Direct mode additional ports

In direct mode, Caddy also listens on per-service ports (configurable in `.env`):

| Port (default) | Service              | Auth |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---- |
| 8446           | TAK Server web admin | LDAP |
| 8888           | MediaMTX HLS         | LDAP |
| 1880           | Node-RED             | LDAP |
| 8180           | Monitor dashboard    | LDAP |

### Subdomain mode routing

In subdomain mode, all services route through Caddy on port 443 via subdomains.

### Internal only (not bound to host)

| Service      | Container Port | Purpose                                        |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| tak-database | 5432           | TAK PostgreSQL (CoT data)                      |
| app-db       | 5432           | App PostgreSQL (LLDAP + Node-RED)              |
| lldap        | 3890           | LDAP server + GraphQL API (internal)           |
| ldap-proxy   | 3389           | LDAP proxy (TAK Server → LLDAP) + forward auth |

Ports 8089 and 8443 are direct TAK client connections — they bypass Caddy because TAK clients use mutual TLS with client certificates.

## Certificate Management

Use `certs.sh` for certificate operations:

```bash
./certs.sh list                          # List all certs
./certs.sh create-client alice           # Create client cert
./certs.sh download alice.p12            # Download .p12 to host
./certs.sh create-server my.domain.com   # Create server cert for hostname
./certs.sh ca-info                       # Show CA details + expiry
./certs.sh create-user webadmin 'Pass!'  # Create TAK admin user
./certs.sh revoke alice                  # Revoke a certificate
```

Run `./certs.sh help` for the full reference. Some certificate operations are also available via the monitor API and dashboard.

Certificate files are also directly accessible on the host at `./tak/certs/files/`.

For detailed information about how TAK certificates work, see [docs/certificates.md](docs/certificates.md).

## User Management

The Monitor dashboard is the primary interface for managing users, groups, and certificate enrollment. Access it at `https://<SERVER_ADDRESS>:8180` (direct mode) or `https://monitor.<SERVER_ADDRESS>` (subdomain mode), logging in as `webadmin`.

### Enrollment flow

1. Create a user in the Monitor dashboard (Users → New User)
2. Assign groups — groups prefixed with `tak_` become TAK channels
3. Click the Enroll button next to the user
4. A QR code (and a `tak://` enrollment URL) appears with a ~15-minute token
5. User scans the QR code with ATAK/iTAK/TAK Aware
6. The TAK client enrolls directly with TAK Server and receives its certificate

For details on authentication flows and LDAP, see [docs/authentication.md](docs/authentication.md).

## Node-RED

Node-RED is available at `https://<SERVER_ADDRESS>:1880` (direct mode) or `https://nodered.<SERVER_ADDRESS>` (subdomain mode).

On first boot, FastTAK pre-installs `node-red-contrib-postgresql` and `node-red-contrib-tak`, and configures a PostgreSQL connection to `app-db`. Flows needing spatial queries should point at `tak-database` instead — it has PostGIS natively. A `nodered` LDAP user is automatically created in the `tak_ROLE_ADMIN` group so CoT messages from Node-RED flows reach all TAK clients.

## Updating

### Component updates (LLDAP, MediaMTX, Node-RED)

Edit the version pin in `.env`, then pull and restart:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

### TAK Server updates

TAK Server images are built locally from the tak.gov release ZIP. `setup.sh`
handles extraction, image builds, and updating `TAK_VERSION` in `.env`.

**Moving an existing deployment to a new TAK Server release is not yet
supported.** Nothing carries the databases across a version change. Back up
first, and read [docs/upgrading.md](docs/upgrading.md) before you start.

## Testing

Run a full greenfield integration test (setup → start → verify → teardown):

```bash
./start.sh --test takserver-docker-hardened-5.8-RELEASE-65.zip
```

This builds from scratch, starts the full stack, runs automated checks, and tears everything down. Requires the tak.gov release ZIP.

## Stopping and Teardown

```bash
# Stop services (preserves databases and ./tak/ .env config)
# 5.8 is the supported floor, and its hardened image lands PGDATA in the mounted
# volume — earlier releases kept cot inside the container, where `down` destroyed
# it. See docs/decisions.md DD-051.
docker compose down

# Full reset (destroys database data, keeps ./tak/ certs and .env config)
docker compose down -v

# Complete wipe (including certs and .env config)
docker compose down -v && rm -rf tak/ .env
```

`./tak/` is a bind-mount — certs, CoreConfig.xml, and logs always survive `down`. Only named volumes (PostgreSQL data) are removed with `-v`.

## Resource Limits

### Memory

Each service has a memory cap enforced in `docker-compose.yml` (via
`deploy.resources.limits.memory`). Starting points below — if your
deployment has larger needs, override per-service via a
`docker-compose.override.yml`.

| Service           | Cap    | Notes                                   |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `tak-server`      | 4 GB   | JVM heap; scales with connected clients |
| `tak-database`    | 2 GB   | PostgreSQL on write-heavy CoT workload  |
| `app-db`          | 1 GB   | PostgreSQL shared by LLDAP + Node-RED   |
| `nodered`         | 512 MB | Node-RED runtime                        |
| `monitor`         | 512 MB | FastAPI management API                  |
| `mediamtx`        | 512 MB | Scales with concurrent streams          |
| `lldap`           | 256 MB | Rust LDAP server                        |
| `caddy`           | 256 MB | Reverse proxy                           |
| `ldap-proxy`      | 128 MB | Go LDAP bind proxy                      |
| `init-config`     | 128 MB | One-shot bash (exits after bootstrap)   |
| `init-identity`   | 256 MB | One-shot Python                         |
| `init-ldap-ready` | 64 MB  | One-shot LDAP bind probe                |

See DD-034 for rationale.

## Troubleshooting

**Services not starting?**

```bash
docker compose ps                           # check status
docker compose logs -f                      # follow all logs
docker compose logs tak-server --tail 50    # specific service
```

**TAK Server not healthy after 5 minutes?**

```bash
docker compose logs tak-server | tail -30
```

**Identity bootstrap failed?**

```bash
docker compose logs init-identity
```

**QR enrollment not working?**

- Ensure TAK Server is healthy: `docker compose ps tak-server`
- Check Monitor logs: `docker compose logs monitor`
- Verify `SERVER_ADDRESS` is reachable from the client device
- Enrollment tokens expire after 15 minutes — generate a fresh QR

**Certificate issues?**

```bash
./certs.sh ca-info    # check CA cert expiry
```

Caddy auto-manages Let's Encrypt certs. TAK Server internal CA cert expiry is monitored by the healthcheck — the container becomes `unhealthy` when any cert is within 30 days of expiring. The monitor dashboard also tracks cert expiry across all TAK certificates.
