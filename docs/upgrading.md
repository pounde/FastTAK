# Upgrading FastTAK

Most upgrades are a `git pull` and a restart. `./setup.sh` pulls the new
release and preserves your `.env`, your certificates and your `CoreConfig.xml`;
`./start.sh` brings the stack back up on the new images.

This page covers the parts that are **not** automatic: the ones that depend on
decisions you made, which no script can make for you.

## Before you upgrade

### 1. Check who can reach the Monitor (v0.28.1 and later)

As of v0.28.1 the Monitor is admin-only, end to end. Every JSON API and every
dashboard page requires membership in `ADMIN_GROUP` (default `monitor_admin`);
only `/api/ping` is open. See [Authentication](authentication.md#authorization-who-may-use-the-monitor).

`webadmin` is added to that group automatically by the identity bootstrap, so if
that is the account you log in with, you keep access.

**Any other admin account must be added to the group before you upgrade**, or it
will get a 403 on every page afterwards. Add users to `monitor_admin` from the
Monitor's Users page, or directly in LLDAP.

!!! warning "Renaming `ADMIN_GROUP`"
    If you set `ADMIN_GROUP` to a custom name, make sure the stack has been
    restarted at least once on v0.28.2 or later. Earlier versions bootstrapped
    only `BACKUP_ADMIN_GROUP`, so a renamed `ADMIN_GROUP` was never created and
    nobody was ever added to it — locking every account out of the Monitor with
    no way back in through the UI. Recovery is to add the group and membership
    in LLDAP directly, or to unset `ADMIN_GROUP` and restart.

### 2. Know what a version bump changes

Check the release notes for the versions you are skipping. FastTAK follows
semantic versioning, and `fix:` releases will not change behaviour you depend on
— but a service being *removed* from the stack is worth knowing about in
advance, because of the next item.

## What the scripts now handle for you

These used to be manual steps and are no longer:

| Rule | Where it is enforced |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| Remove containers for services deleted from the compose file | `--remove-orphans` in `start.sh`, `reconfig.sh`, and `just up` |
| Generate any newly required secrets on a fresh install | `setup.sh` |
| Create and populate the Monitor's gate groups | `init-identity` on every stack start |
| Refuse to start on a missing or unsafe `.env` value | `scripts/check-env.sh`, called from `start.sh` |

### Why `--remove-orphans` matters

`docker compose up` does **not** remove a container whose service has been
deleted from the compose file. It keeps running on its old configuration,
invisible to `docker compose ps`, surviving every subsequent upgrade.

This is not hypothetical. `tak-portal` was removed from the stack in
[DD-043](decisions.md) because it had become unauthenticated after Authentik was
replaced — and on at least one deployment the container kept running for months
afterwards, because nothing removed it.

If you upgraded before this was fixed, check once:

```bash
docker ps --format '{{.Names}}'
```

Anything not in `docker compose config --services` is an orphan. Remove it:

```bash
docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
```

## After you upgrade

Confirm the stack is healthy and that you can still get in:

```bash
docker compose ps            # every service up; none unexpected
curl -sf http://localhost:8080/api/ping   # from inside the monitor container
```

Then load the Monitor dashboard in a browser and confirm the pages render. A 403
on every page means the account you are logged in with is not in `ADMIN_GROUP` —
see step 1 above.

## Recovering from a Monitor lockout

If every page 403s and you have no admin account left in the group, you can fix
it from LLDAP without the Monitor. LLDAP's own web UI is not exposed by default,
so work through the container:

1. Confirm which group the Monitor is gating on — the value of `ADMIN_GROUP` in
   `.env`, or `monitor_admin` if unset.
2. Add your account to that group in LLDAP.
3. Restart the monitor so nothing is cached: `docker compose restart monitor`.

The group name is read per request, so renaming it in `.env` takes effect on the
next request after a monitor restart — no rebuild needed.
